# Authentication
# Authentication to the API occurs via HTTP Basic Auth. Use api-key as the user name and your API key is the password. Here is how you use basic HTTP auth with curl:
# curl --user 'api-key:{api-key}' --url 'https://api.getAddress.io/v2/uk/sw1a2aa' 
#
# Alternative Authentication
# Alternatively, you can just add the 'api-key' as a query string parameter 
# For example: 'https://api.getAddress.io/v2/uk/sw1a2aa?api-key=L2L8QgsFOk2A5CpnFpY15w2632'
#
# The API uses HTTPs only. Plain HTTP connections are refused.
#
# Please use a separate API key for each of your applications/web-sites.
#
# Stay in touch
# If you have an issue, a question, a suggestion, a request, or if you just want to tell us something, please email us at support@getAddress.io
